### Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r}
library(leaflet)
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R") %>% # add a marker
  addPopups(-1.6, 53.3, popup = "Hello Sheffield!") %>% 
  # add som circles:
  addCircles(color = "black", runif(90, -2, -1), runif(90, 53, 54), runif(90, 10, 500))
m  # Print the map
```
